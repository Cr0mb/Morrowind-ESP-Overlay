# Morrowind-ESP-Overlay
This Python script creates an overlay for *The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind* that displays additional information about in-game entities. Features include showing entity names, health bars, and health values in real-time. The overlay is rendered using PyQt5, while memory reading is done via `pymem` to fetch game data.
